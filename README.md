# Vaadin Spreadsheet demo

Vaadin Spreadsheet demo showcases most of the functionality
in Vaadin Spreadsheet. You can try out the demo [online](http://demo.vaadin.com/spreadsheet/).

## Installing License Key
You need to install a license key before compiling the widget set. The license
key is checked during widget set compilation, so you do not need it when
deploying the application.

You can purchase Vaadin Spreadsheet or obtain a free trial key from the
[Vaadin Spreadsheet download page](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/vaadin-spreadsheet)
in Vaadin Directory.

You need to register in Vaadin Directory to
obtain the key. See [Installing Commercial Vaadin Add-on Licence](https://vaadin.com/docs/-/part/framework/addons/addons-cval.html)
for detailed instructions on obtaining and installing the license key.

## Compile Widgetset and start the Web server
* Compile the widget set either by clicking **Compile Widgetset** in the Eclipse
  toolbar or by running the *vaadin:compile* goal with Maven.
* Start the server by running *jetty:run* goal with Maven.
* Open the URL *http://localhost:8080/spreadsheet* in a browser.
